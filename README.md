<p>Driven by a passion to develop outstanding UI for the future of applications by writing clean, effective and well-tested code.
I love to affect others with contagious positivity in hopes that they are inspired to spread some themselves.
I strive to consistently learn and push myself to grow in to a better version of myself. </p>
